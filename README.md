## üìùDescription
Simple shell is a custom program that replicates some simple features of the UNIX shell originally built by Ken Thompson. 
It was completed as part of a group project for Holberton School Australia.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All code was written in Betty Style.
- No more than 5 functions per file.

## Features
- Supports interactive annd non-interactive mode
- Handles basic errors
- Custom built-in functions:
	- `env` exits the shell
	- `exit`prints the current environment
- Executes commands using the `$PATH` environment variable

## Compilation
- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 ITS gcc version 11.40
- All .c files with the shell.c file were compiled this way:
  <br /><br />
  `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c`

## File Contents
